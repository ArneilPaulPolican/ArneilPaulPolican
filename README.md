# Hi there, I'm Arneil Paul Polican! üëã

## :rocket: About Me
I'm a blockchain enthusiast with a strong interest in decentralized technologies. My journey began with exploring blockchain fundamentals, and since then, I‚Äôve delved deeply into Substrate-based blockchain development. I've been working extensively in Web3 and cloud-native applications, particularly focusing on off-chain integrations within the Polkadot ecosystem to support XODE NFT application development.

In addition to my work in blockchain, I have a strong background as a Web Application Engineer and currently lead DevOps operations. I‚Äôve developed scalable web applications using modern frameworks such as .NET Core, Laravel, NestJS, and FastAPI for APIs, as well as Vue, Angular, and Next.js for client-side applications. My focus includes microservices architecture, CI/CD automation, and cloud-native infrastructure. I‚Äôm particularly interested in streamlining development workflows and improving operational efficiency, managing server infrastructure primarily through Proxmox VE, rather than relying on cloud providers like AWS, GCP, or Azure.

üèóÔ∏è Working on Xode-blockchain, a blockchain platform with on-chain governance for game development and business applications.

üí° Exploring Smoldot for lightweight blockchain client development.

üõ†Ô∏è Building APIs with Nestjs, .NET Core, Laravel and modern web applications with Angular, Vue and React.

‚öôÔ∏è Setting up CI/CD deployment workflows on Linux for various frameworks, including FastAPI, NestJS, Laravel, Vue, Angular, and React. This involves configuring automated testing, containerized deployments using Docker, and implementing zero-downtime deployment strategies to ensure seamless rollouts.
