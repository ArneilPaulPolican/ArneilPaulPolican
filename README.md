# Hi there, I'm Arneil Paul Polican! 👋

## :rocket: About Me
I'm a blockchain enthusiast with a strong interest in decentralized technologies. My journey started with exploring blockchain fundamentals, and I have since dived deep into Substrate-based blockchain development, Rust, Solidity, and cloud-native applications. 

Beyond blockchain, I have extensive experience as a Web Application Engineer and DevOps Team Lead. I have designed and implemented scalable and secure web applications using modern frameworks like .NET Core, Angular, and more. My expertise includes architecting microservices, optimizing CI/CD pipelines, and ensuring high availability of cloud-native applications. I am passionate about automating deployments, container orchestration, and maintaining robust DevOps workflows.

🏗️ Working on Xode-blockchain, a blockchain platform with on-chain governance for game development and business applications.

💡 Exploring Smoldot for lightweight blockchain client development.

🛠️ Building APIs with Nestjs, .NET Core, Laravel and modern web applications with Angular, Vue and React.

⚙️ Setting up CI/CD deployment workflows on Linux for various frameworks, including FastAPI, NestJS, Laravel, Vue, Angular, and React. This involves configuring automated testing, containerized deployments using Docker, and implementing zero-downtime deployment strategies to ensure seamless rollouts.
